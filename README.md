# sentiment_analysis

# Project Overview
This sentiment analysis project aims to classify user reviews as positive or negative based on their textual content. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, the project provides a web interface where users can input review texts and receive instant sentiment predictions.

# Key Features
1. Text Preprocessing: Cleans and processes input text by removing HTML tags, URLs, special characters, digits, and stopwords. The text is also converted to lowercase and lemmatized to ensure uniformity and improve model performance.
2. Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a Naive Bayes classifier trained on a bag-of-words representation of the review texts to predict sentiment.
3. Web Interface: A user-friendly web application built with Django that allows users to enter review text and view the sentiment prediction.
4. Model Persistence: Uses pickled files to store the trained CountVectorizer and Naive Bayes model for efficient loading and prediction.
5. Deployment: The application is deployed on a platform such as Render, ensuring it is accessible online with minimized downtime.
# Project Components
1. Data Preprocessing

Converts input text to lowercase.
Removes HTML tags, URLs, special characters, digits, and stopwords.
Lemmatizes the text to its base form.
2. Model Training

Uses CountVectorizer to transform text data into a bag-of-words model.
Trains a Naive Bayes classifier on the transformed data.
Pickles the trained model and vectorizer for future use.
3. Web Application

Input Section: Allows users to input review text.
Prediction Section: Displays the sentiment prediction (positive or negative) based on the input text.
User Interface: The interface is designed to be clean and responsive, with input and output sections styled for clarity and ease of use.
4. Deployment

The application is hosted on Render
Uses gunicorn as the WSGI server for running the Django application.
# Technical Stack
1. Backend: Python, Django
2. Machine Learning: scikit-learn, NLTK
3. Web Server: Gunicorn
4. Deployment: Render
5. Version Control: Git
# How It Works
User Input: The user enters a review text into the text box on the web interface.
Preprocessing: The input text is preprocessed to remove noise and standardize it.
Prediction: The preprocessed text is transformed using the CountVectorizer and fed into the Naive Bayes model to predict the sentiment.
Output: The predicted sentiment (positive or negative) is displayed on the web page.
# Usage
Developers: Can extend the project by integrating more advanced NLP techniques, additional preprocessing steps, or different machine learning models.
End Users: Can easily input their review texts and receive sentiment analysis results, useful for product reviews, feedback analysis, and more.
# Future Enhancements
Advanced NLP: Incorporate advanced techniques such as word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) or transformer models (e.g., BERT).
Improved UI/UX: Enhance the user interface with more interactive elements and visualizations.
Additional Features: Add support for analyzing multiple reviews at once, providing detailed sentiment scores, and integrating with social media APIs for real-time sentiment analysis.
This sentiment analysis project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in text analysis and provides a foundation for more sophisticated NLP projects.
